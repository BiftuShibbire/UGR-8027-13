         century and is known for building the monolithic rock-hewn churches at the Zagwe

         into architecture.

         remains of several well-preserved royal castles, including those in 
         Fasil Ghebbi (Royal Enclosure), for which Gondar has been called the 
         “Camelot of Africa”. This UNESCO registered site is an ideal touristic destination
          that connects almost all of the historic routes in Ethiopia
